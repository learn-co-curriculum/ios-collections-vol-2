# Collections Practice

### Skills: iteration, arrays, dictionaries, nested data structures

## Instructions

The goal of this lab is to become proficient manipulating the basic data structures we use in objective-c, dictionaries and arrays.  Try experimenting with the built in NSDictionary and NSArray methods as well as implementing your own logic to solve these.  Write methods that solve each of the unit tests. All solutions should be generic and work for any "case".
These problems should get progressively more difficult.
